*Introduction*

##Business Overview##

Bank of America receives thousands of customer complaints each year reported through the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). These complaints span various financial products including Savings Accounts, Credit Reporting, Credit Cards, Mortgages, Money Transfers, and Debt Collection, and are submitted through multiple channels such as web, referrals, phone, and postal mail.

Although the bank has established processes for receiving, reviewing, and responding to complaints, it lacks a centralized analytical system that provides clear visibility into complaint patterns, geographical hotspots, response performance, and emerging risks. The absence of a unified analysis limits the bank’s ability to identify root causes, prioritize operational improvements, and proactively reduce customer dissatisfaction.

This project aims to deliver an end-to-end analysis of customer complaints recorded between 2017 and 2023, supported by an interactive Power BI dashboard that answers the critical business questions needed for operational, regulatory, and strategic decision-making.
