**Introduction**


This project analyzes consumer complaint data submitted to Bank of America to identify key trends, patterns, and drivers behind customer issues. By examining complaint categories, response types, resolution timeliness, and customer sentiment, the analysis provides insights that support better service delivery, operational efficiency, and data-driven decision-making. The goal is to help stakeholders understand where complaints originate, how effectively they are resolved, and what opportunities exist to improve the overall customer experience.
